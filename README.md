# Visualicious: Meaningful Vizualization Group 1

This is the repository for the Visualicious project, a project created for the course Meaningful Visualisation.

---

## Project aims

This project aims to be a crime [dashboard](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8443395/) for the country of the Netherlands. It implores the users to explore the country, first province by province and later munincipality by munincipality, and provides a variety of information on the crimes in this area, as well as providing the option to cross-reference these crime statistics with a few socio-economic factors to paint a more comprehensinve picture of the selected region.

This project limits itself to theft and theft-adjacent crimes, such as vehicle theft, pickpockets and robbery (to name a few). It aims to be an interactive, drill-down experience in which the user themselves can select what they want to learn.

## Running the project

The entire project is included in this repository. The project can be found by running the ``index.html`` on the localhost and navigating to the correct address. This can be done through a variety of ways, but we recommend using the ``five server`` vscode extension.

1. Open this project with visual studio code (the blue icon, if yours is purple you are using Visual Studio, which is a different program)
2. Navigate to the extensions pane by clicking the extensions button on the left-hand side of your screen. It looks like a tetris square, with the top right block seperated.
3. Search for and install the ``five server`` extension using the search bar
   Note: Its full name is ``Live server (five server)`` which, depending on the size of the screen, gets cut off to ``Live server (...`` Its icon looks like a purple 5, with two purple wifi-stripes next to it
4. Once installed, restart visual studio code
5. Once restarted, open the file navigation pane on the left-hand side of the screen. It can be found by clicking the top button in the navigation bar, or by using the ``ctrl+shift+E`` shortcut on your keyboard
6. Navigate to the Code/webapp/ folder
7. Right-click on the ``index.html`` file and select ``open with five server``
8. If everything was done well, vscode will automatically open your default browser and open the dashboard.
9. For support, contact us using the github bug-report function, or by email c.o.vanwetten@students.uu.nl

## Project outline

This project is structured as follows:

```
Visualicious/
|-Code/
|-	- data wrangling/
|-	-	- archive/
|-	- webapp/
|-	-	- css/
|-	-	- js/
|-Data/
|-Documentation/
|-	- Data understanding/
|-	- Evaluation/
|- 	- Infovis design/
|-	- Sketches/
|- LICENSE
|- ProjectVideo_Visualicious
|- README.MD
```

The code/ folder holds all the code necessary for this project to work, including the python scripts used for data cleaning and processing (data wrangling/), with the old .csv files still saved in the archive/ folder. The webapp itself is in the webapp/ folder, with all the css and js seperated in their own css/ and js/ folders.

Secondly, the data/ folder holds all the data for this project, including the crimes.tsv, as well as the munincipualties.geojson, the provinces.geojson and the outline.geojson, which are all used to draw the map. Finally, the data/ folder holds the education.csv and SES-WOA.csv, which are used for the education and SES-WOA score charts respectively.

Furthermore, the Documentation/ folder holds all the documentation for this project. Including screenshots of the steps we took to understand the data better (Data understanding/), the results of the Evaluation performed on {TODO VOEG DATUM TOE} (Evaluation/), the initial hi-fi prototype and storyboards of the data story that we wanted to tell (Infovis design/). Lastly, the initial lo-fi sketches made during the brainstorming of this project can be found in the Sketches/ folder. Do note that this folder has a variety of sketches that are *not* in the final project. This is on purpose. We pruposefully over-drew and designed *too many* sketches, with the goal of selecting the best, most interesting and most novel visualizations later on in the proces.

Finally, the LICENSE outlines the terms and conditions of our GNU General Public License, the ProjectVideo_Visualicious is a video presentation of this project, and README.md is the file you are currently reading.
